# Face Detection
**Face detection** is a branch of **image processing** that uses machine learning to **detect faces in images, videos and on live streaming**


### FaceDetection is the Algorithm to find the face in the video or in Live Stream and images also


* Running on the windows 

### Live Detection 

    > python3 FaceRecognition.py // For Live detection of the video

### Image Detection

    > python3 ImageDetection.py // for Images 

### Video Detection

    > python3 VideoStream.py // For videos


* Running on Windows 

1. Open your favirote idle
2. clone this repo
3. open FaceRecognition.py file
4. run FaceRecognition.py // For Live
5. Now visit your **data** folder, you can file faces in this folder

* Work with Images and Videos also on Windows

:point_right: Just change the File from ***Point 4***


that's it, now check in your data folder we are going to see the image of the face

it will give exact frame where algorithm was detecting the face
